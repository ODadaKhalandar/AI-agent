An AI Agent is a software system that can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, or gather information on behalf of users. It uses artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data processing, to understand inputs, retrieve relevant information, and generate useful outputs.

Key Characteristics of an AI Agent:

1. Autonomy: An AI Agent operates independently to perform tasks, gather data, or execute commands without constant human oversight.


2. Data Handling: AI agents often read from datasets or other inputs (like CSV files, databases, or APIs) and use this data to make informed decisions or provide insights.


3. Interactivity and Communication: Many AI agents can interact with users via interfaces (like a web dashboard) or communicate back and forth in natural language.


4. Task-Specific Actions: Theyâ€™re often designed for specific purposes like searching for information online, analyzing data, summarizing content, or even conversing as chatbots.



Types of AI Agents:

Reactive Agents: They respond to specific inputs without maintaining a history. For instance, a chatbot answering simple queries based on keywords.

Model-Based/Goal-Oriented Agents: These agents pursue specific goals, making decisions based on the state of the environment and past interactions.

Learning Agents: They continuously learn from data, adjusting their behavior over time based on new information.


Applications of AI Agents:

Information Retrieval: Searching the web, extracting specific data, or summarizing documents.

Personal Assistants: Scheduling tasks, sending reminders, or handling routine inquiries (like Siri or Alexa).

Customer Service Bots: Answering customer questions or resolving simple service requests in real-time.

Data Extraction Agents: Automating data collection and processing for fields like research or market analysis.


In this project, your AI Agent will:

Read data from CSV or Google Sheets and identify a primary entity (like a company name).

Perform automated web searches to retrieve specific information based on the user's query (e.g., finding contact information for companies).

Use an LLM (Large Language Model) to analyze the search results and extract the required information.

Display and store results in an accessible format, such as a downloadable CSV or an updated Google Sheet.


This type of agent helps automate data gathering and processing, making it easier for users to obtain structured insights from large datasets.# AI-agent
